Multi-criteria design of experiments algorithm that simultaneously optimizes up
to six different criteria (I, Id, D, Ds, A and As). The algorithm finds the
optimal Pareto front and, if requested, selects a possible symmetrical design on
it. The symmetrical design is selected based on two techniques: minimum distance
with the Utopia point or the TOPSIS approach.
